        <h2><b>Shooting Star Memorial</b>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Laura stopped crying when she mailed the ashes. The UPS was freezing, even colder than the November day outside. The lights made the whole place look like shit, especially since UPS's classic brown covered everything. The men who worked behind the counter had stopped staring about five minutes into her sniffling tears, so they didn't notice her calm when she finally she pushed the package over the counter. Then she left quickly, and walked the blocks back to her apartment without paying much attention. </p>
        <p>As Laura unlocked the door, she noticed the half-moons under her fingernails had turned purple like watered down grape juice she drank when she was five years old. Her mother had always said, "the sugar in that stuff will kill you!"</p>
        <p>Laura's living room seemed emptier than usual, as if all the furniture had moved a few inches away from the center of the room when she was out. She decided to give up standing and slumped into a pleather armchair. She pulled out her phone and scrolled through her contacts. Tracing her finger up and down the screen, she thought about the predictable conversations she would have with her distant friends and preoccupied siblings. After a few minutes, she gave in and dialed her ex-husband, closing her eyes as she heard the ringing.</p>
        <p>"Hi Laura. Sorry, but this really isn't a good—"</p>
        <p>"I did it, Ted," she interrupted.</p>
        <p>"What?" She could hear the sound of him shuffling papers and pictured him at his gargantuan desk, the one that in their marriage’s final years he had spent almost every night at, writing strategy for his next case.</p>
        <p>"I followed through with her will.” She paused, waiting for the few seconds of recognition it took him to remember what she was even talking about. “I did it and now her ashes are headed to NASA for their next flight up. It wasn’t as expensive as I’d expected, actually. 2,500 dollars for the ‘Shooting Star Memorial.’ Plus shipping."</p>
        <p>"Oh... wow. It’s been a couple months since the funeral, huh?”</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I guess." Laura kneaded her forehead. Ted didn’t say anything else, so she kept talking. “I don’t think I’m going to go to the launch— I feel like John or Alice would be more into it. They were always the science-y children. Mom loved to show them her papers and get their opinions. She barely even talked to me when I visited the university last fall to see her presentation on Black Holes.” She found herself starting to ramble and opened her eyes. “In any case, I did my part. They’ll send me the certificate.”</p>
        <p>"So the container will really be flying up by Mars?" He spoke like a boy learning about space for the first time.</p>
        <p>"Well, yeah Ted. My mother will be flying around Mars." Her voice was coming out slower than before.</p>  
        <p>"Oh, fuck, yeah I'm sorry Laura. She was quite the lady. I always loved listening to her rant at Christmas about those ‘crack-pots who spend their time researching UFOs and call themselves scientists.’ Hah, maybe she'll see some cool aliens up there herself though, right?"</p>
        <p>She dropped the phone on the floor as she hung up, and started to cry again. She tried lying down on her bed to take a nap, but she couldn’t stop staring at the windowsill. The urn had sat there since the end of August, bronze and cold. Sometimes when the light came through her window the shadows from the urn fell onto the floor. They shifted and morphed into curious shapes, and Laura would spend a minute examining them as she dressed in the mornings. She had only volunteered to take it because John and Alice both had children and busy lives, and they had handled all the funeral arrangements. She hadn’t expected the emptiness to be so potent now that the urn was gone. </p>
        <p>She tried watching TV. She flipped past the news and the latest Star Trek movie, coming to land on the infomercial channel. An ad for the newest brand of electric stove was just finishing up. The woman on screen wiped her hands on the bright yellow apron she was wearing and invited Laura to, “Stay tuned for how to get in on Dr. Theodore Matts’ exciting new venture!” Laura no longer had the energy to change the channel, so she watched as the screen turned burnt beige and words appeared:</p>
        <p><div id= "prose-center"><b>Create Your Own Reality</b></id></p>
      <p>A man with large glasses and a cheap-looking lab coat replaced the title frame. He was sitting at a metal desk and the night sky was green-screened behind him. “Are you bored easily? Do you tire of seeing the same people on your bus every day, of walking down the same gray streets, of the scuffs on your sneakers? Are you happiest in your dreams? Well, my name is Dr. Theodore Matts and I’m here today to tell you about the newest frontiers of virtual reality.” He stood up and walked to another table, this one filled with test tubes and beakers. “I present to you the easiest, most inexpensive way to liven up the world around you.” The camera zoomed in as the doctor pulled a small white pill out of his pocket. “Realezine.” Laura could see a tiny R printed on the tablet. “The first and only drug in the virtual reality market! One pill will take you to Paris, under the sea, or into space for an hour-long trip. Don’t believe me? Just try it! Call the number on the screen below me to get your sample NOW. 1-800-TOOREAL. Call now, and get two pills for the price of one!”</p>
      <p>Laura shut off the TV and looked at the windowsill. The sky was dark outside already but she felt claustrophobic sitting in her bedroom, so she went out for a walk.  She didn't mind the dark. She headed west, letting the wind chap her face. A walk along the river felt like the only choice. The walk was slow, and Laura really couldn't tell how much time had passed when she reached the path that ran parallel to the water. She found a bench to rest on. She sat there for a while before taking out her phone and making a call.
        “Hello,” an automated voice greeted her. “You’ve reached the order line for Realezine. The wait time to speak with a customer associate is….” Laura heard several loud beeps, “15 minutes. Please hold.” Music that sounded vaguely French started to play, and Dr. Theodore Matts’ voice whispered over it, “...Paris, under the sea, into space… Let Realezine take your mind on a journey…”</p>
      <p>Laura released a deep breath and let her head fall backwards, neck arching past the back of the bench, surpassing any point of comfort. She stayed there, unsupported, and opened her eyes to look at what was above her. Laura didn't often see stars in her sky, so she wasn't surprised when the three or four twinkles in her vision disappeared as the clouds expanded their cover.</p>
